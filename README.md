## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

It's a quick project so there isn't much to say.

This is the first time I use TypeScript and so far, it's a bit confusing. Sure I could see error even when I'm still coding. But setting types is sometimes tricky because I didn't know what type something is (a bit hard to explain, you need to try it yourself).

### Continued development

Despite confusing, I didn't plan to stop using TypeScript.
